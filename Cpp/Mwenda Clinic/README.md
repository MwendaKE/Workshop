I am not a doctor. But  I have a clinic. When you are a programmer, you can create almost anything you like. The only limit is your CPU. You see here? I have a clinic and I have powers to manage patients. I think I can cure them too. My powers are super powerful. I can even create a better world and live in it without anybody else in there. Just me and my computer and my dog!
