change to this directory.
=========================
$ cd /storage/emulated/0/DCI-X/GIT/Workshop/JavaScript/Intermediate/quotegeneratorjson

then start any server. e.g:
==========================
$ python -m http.server 8000

or a node server:
=================
$ npm install -g serve // install it
$ cd /storage/emulated/0/DCI-X/GIT/Workshop/JavaScript/Intermediate/quotegeneratorjson
$ serve

Why this?
=========

A server is needed here because of how modern browsers handle security for local files:

---

1. The Problem with fetch() on local files

In your project, you’re using this:


fetch("quotes.json")

If you open index.html directly in a browser (file:// URL), the browser blocks fetch() from reading local files.

This is due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and security restrictions — browsers prevent scripts from reading local files for safety.

---

2. How a server fixes it

A server serves your files over HTTP instead of file://.

When you use a server, the browser sees your HTML and JSON as coming from the same origin (same domain + port), so fetch() works.

Example:


http://localhost:8000/index.html
http://localhost:8000/quotes.json

Now, fetch("quotes.json") works because both are on the same server.

---

3. Extra benefits of a server

Lets you test dynamic features (fetching JSON, APIs, etc.).

Allows you to simulate a real web environment.

Needed for future projects with Node.js backend or databases.

---

💡 Summary:
Without a server, your JS cannot read local JSON files due to browser security. A server makes your project behave like it’s live on the web, solving this restriction.
