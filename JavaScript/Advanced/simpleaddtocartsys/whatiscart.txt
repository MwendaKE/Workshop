When a user “adds an item to the cart,” it doesn’t immediately buy anything. It means:

1. The app stores the item temporarily (in memory, localStorage, or database) as part of the user’s “cart.”


2. It usually tracks: item ID, name, price, quantity.


3. The cart shows a summary of items the user intends to buy.


4. Later, when the user checks out, the app processes these items for payment and order creation.



In short: “Add to cart” = remember the item for potential purchase.
