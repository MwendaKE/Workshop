🧩 What is a Multi-file Program in C++?
=========================================
When your program becomes bigger, it’s hard to keep all the code in one file.
So, we split the program into separate files, each having a specific job.
This makes your project cleaner, easier to read, and easier to fix.

🧱 The Three Files We Used
==========================
We created three files:

1️⃣ main.cpp — The starting point of the program
-------------
Think of this as the remote control that starts everything.
It tells the computer to start the app.
It creates and shows the main window.
It runs the program until the user closes it.

👉 You can think of main.cpp as the “brain that starts the engine”.



2️⃣ mainwindow.h — The blueprint (header file)
----------------
This file declares what our main window will have — like a design plan.
It doesn’t contain real work;
it just tells C++ what exists in our window, for example:
What variables the window has (like buttons, lists, etc.)
What functions exist (like addTask() and removeTask())

💡 Analogy: It’s like an architect’s drawing of a house — not the house itself, just the plan.



3️⃣ mainwindow.cpp — The real builder (implementation file)
------------------
This is where we write the actual code that makes the window work.

Here we say:

How the window looks (layout, buttons, etc.)
What happens when you click “Add Task”
What happens when you click “Remove Task”

💡 Analogy: If mainwindow.h is the design,
mainwindow.cpp is the person actually building the house.


⚙️ Why Split Code This Way?

Organization - Easy to find where things are — main.cpp starts the app, mainwindow.h declares things, mainwindow.cpp does the real work.
Reusability - You can reuse the same class (like MainWindow) in other projects easily.
Faster compiling - When you change one part, only that file is recompiled — not everything.
Teamwork - Different people can work on different files at the same time.

🧠 Important Words and Macros in the Code
=========================================
🔹 #include
-----------------
This means “bring in code from another file or library”.

Example:
#include <QPushButton>   // Brings the QPushButton class from Qt
#include "mainwindow.h"  // Brings our custom class we made

So your file can use features from other files.

🔹 #ifndef, #define, #endif
-------------------------------
These are header guards — they prevent a file from being included twice.

Example:
#ifndef MAINWINDOW_H
#define MAINWINDOW_H
// ... code ...
#endif

💡 Think of it like a security guard who says:
“Wait! We already included this file once, don’t repeat it!”
Without this, your code could break with “duplicate definition” errors.

🔹 Q_OBJECT
---------------
This macro is special to Qt.

It enables Qt’s signal and slot system —
that’s how Qt buttons “talk” to functions (like when you click).

Without Q_OBJECT, your connect() calls wouldn’t work.

🔹 private slots:
------------------
This tells Qt:
“These are special functions that will be called when something happens.”

For example:
void addTask();  // Will be called when you click the Add button

🔹 connect(...)
------------------
This links a button click to a function.

Example:
connect(addButton, &QPushButton::clicked, this, &MainWindow::addTask);

This means:
When the addButton is clicked → run addTask().

🔹 QApplication
------------------
This is the manager of your whole app.
It handles things like:

Drawing windows
Handling clicks
Keeping the app running until it’s closed
You must have exactly one QApplication in every Qt GUI app.
